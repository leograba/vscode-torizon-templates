# Dart CLI Template

This Dart CLI template is based on [Get started: Command-line and server apps](https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/get-started).

It was created with the command from [create a small app](https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/get-started#3-create-a-small-app):

```sh
dart create -t console .
```

And on top of that, things required for the Torizon Extension for VS Code (ApolloX) were added.
